# 3=Test RandGen (and other self-tests)
# 4=Tally an election with votes you enter
# 1
# Answer a sequence of questions indicating what output format you want for

# 0. Simulation output file name? enter name or <return> is not desired.
# testSaturday22
# Simulatin output will be written to: testSaturday22.out
# 
# I. voting methods (1) sorted-by-regret or (2) by voting-method-number?
# [The latter, while arbitrary, has the advantage of invariance throughout the run.]
# 2
# sorting by voting method number.
# II. output (1) plain ASCII (2) TeX table formatting (3) HTML table formatting?
# 1
# plain ASCII.
# III. BRs (1) plain (2) normalized so SociallyBest=0, RandomWinner=1
#      (3) normalized so SociallyBest=100, RandomWinner=0, WorseThanRandom<0?
# 3
# Best=100, Random=0.
# IV. Error bars (1) on every BR value (2) omit & only compute for RandomWinner
# 2
# omit error bars.
# V. Print Agreement counts with (1) true-utility(undistorted) Condorcet Winners, (2) vote-based CWs
# 1
# true-utility CWs.
# VI. Print out intermethod winner-agreement-count tables (1) no, (2) yes
# 1
# NO agree-count tables.
# VII. Print out regrets for (1) no, (2) only best 10, (3) all methods
# 1
# No regrets printed (minimum verbosity).
# VIII. (1) All parameter knob-settings, or (2) restricted ranges?
# 2
# Restricted Ranges...
# Honesty fraction range - default is 0 100:
# 50 100
# Honesty fraction range [50, 100] chosen.
# Candidate Number range - default is 2 7 [but this range ignored if real-world dataset]:
# 2 7
# Candidate number range [2, 7] chosen.
# Voter Number range - default is 2 2048 [but this range ignored if real-world dataset:
# 1024 2048
# Voter number range [1024, 2048] chosen.
# Number of elections to try per scenario - default is 59
# 59
# Trying 59 elections per scenario.
# IX. (1) Machine or (2) Real-world-based utilities?
# 1
# Machine.
# Select which utility-generators you want (default 0 thru 15):
#  0: RandomNormalUtils
#  1: IssueDotProd[1]
#  2: IssueDotProd[2]
