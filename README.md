# IEVS
Warren D. Smith's Infinitely Extendible Voting System comparison engine (IEVS)

My current to do's for this project are:
- Get it running as is with gcc in my win10 / vscode environment.
- Understand what it does and why
- Add a few new methods to more fully understand them and how this works
- Add  Voter Satisfaction Efficiency (VSE) in addition to Bayesian Regret
    - which is VSE(method)=1-[BR(method) / BR(Random Ballot)] 
- Compare results with vse-sim and understand why there are differences
- Add analysis of individual simulations what factors of goodness are being vialated? For exmample: vote splitting, latter no harm...
