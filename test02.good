What do you want to do?
1=BayesianRegrets
2=YeePicture
3=Test RandGen (and other self-tests)
4=Tally an election with votes you enter
Answer a sequence of questions indicating what output format you want for
the regret tables:
0. Simulation output file name? enter name or <return> is not desired.
Simulatin output will be written to: testSim02.out

I. voting methods (1) sorted-by-regret or (2) by voting-method-number?
[The latter, while arbitrary, has the advantage of invariance throughout the run.]
sorting by voting method number.
II. output (1) plain ASCII (2) TeX table formatting (3) HTML table formatting?
plain ASCII.
III. BRs (1) plain (2) normalized so SociallyBest=0, RandomWinner=1
     (3) normalized so SociallyBest=100, RandomWinner=0, WorseThanRandom<0?
plain.
IV. Error bars (1) on every BR value (2) omit & only compute for RandomWinner
omit error bars.
V. Print Agreement counts with (1) true-utility(undistorted) Condorcet Winners, (2) vote-based CWs
true-utility CWs.
VI. Print out intermethod winner-agreement-count tables (1) no, (2) yes
NO agree-count tables.
VII. Print out regrets for (1) no, (2) only best 10, (3) all methods
All regrets printed (maximum verbosity).
VIII. (1) All parameter knob-settings, or (2) restricted ranges?
All settings.
IX. (1) Machine or (2) Real-world-based utilities?
