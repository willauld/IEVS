- add run parameters as part of the output in the .out file
- try some types of concurancy to improve performance
- in BRdriver() change utility loop to use input parameters assuming these parameters have been checked for being within bounds previously
- make it so .ini file can have all definitions (no commented out) but only execute the do = new section
- Work on performance through concurancy / parallism
  - Prerequisite
    - make many global variable local so they don't get in the way
    - choose a style or styles of parallelism to try for best performance
      - OpenMP? CPI (go style)?
